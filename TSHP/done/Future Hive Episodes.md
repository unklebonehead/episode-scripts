### To get started as Reccommended by @hivepeople
Hive people has written a really great post on how to get started so I'm going to ask you to go read the full post [here](https://peakd.com/hive-198524/@hivepeople/hive-for-noobs-hive-198524).  But in a a nutshell here is the process if you are brand new and are not coming from Steem as I was.
>If you're brand-new to Hive and need a free account, we think the easiest way to get a free and instant Hive account is with Esteem app: https://esteem.app/signup 

Now for some reason or another eSteem was having issues that day but I was able to sign up through an @Engrave account by going through a link on https://signup.hive.io/ Just what ever you do dont give up. You will get in. Keep in mind these are real people and not some random bots that approve your invite. 
#### The Process was simple enough.
When you clik on the big sign up button it takes you to a page that has list of users offering invites, whether they will hive delegated, any requirements to prove you are real and not a spammer. An estimated response time from them and how many invites they have remaining. Just choose one and click on the claim link on the far right and follow the instructions. Like I said pretty simple. By the way my invite said to expect 72 hrs for a response. I got in within 3-4 hrs. Thats pretty damn quick in my book.

## THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!
**Save your private keys!** NOBODY CAN SEND THEM TO YOU AGAIN, **EVER!** If you loose them they are gone forever. You will have to start over with brand new keys and new identity. They are randomly generated and not stored in any database. These are not passwords. You have to think of them as a physical metal key to get into your house. Save them on a usb stick, sd card or print them out on paper! It can not be stressed enough. **SAVE YOUR KEYS!!!!!**

#### How I post
When I'm at home or on the laptop on wifi. I use [PeakD](https://peakd.com) through the Brave browser. I also tend to switch hit and use the [eSteem](https://esteem.app/) desktop app as well. While I'm on the browser subject you can use a couple of extensions on Brave. There is HiveSigner and/or Hive Keychain. I'm currently running Hivesigner on the Frankenputer big dog computer and Hive Keychain on my Chromebook C300 running GalliumOS.And both work beautifully. I honestly cant decide which one I like better. It does seem to be that Hive Keychain is just a tad faster on the C300 than the Frankenputer.
 
When I'm on mobile, which is 80% of the week I currently use 2 android apps. I use [Hive Wallet](https://hivewallet.app/) and/or [eSteem's android app](https://esteem.app). I admit that eSteem is my go to android app currently. Because it just works. But HiveWallet does have a browser that lets you use other hive apps such as PeakD. It is honestly a little clanky at the moment but it is still ver, very new as with everything in the Hive ecosystem. But that is what is making this jouney so damn exciting!
