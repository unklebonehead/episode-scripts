Engrave is free and easy to use. You can choose your website's design from 6 modern and nice-looking templates. You won't pay anything unless you earn something. And if so, everything will be settled-up automatically!

- All content is stored directly in HIVE blockchain. You don't need to own any dedicated server or other hosting

- Simple but powerfull website templates with integrated HIVE accounts handling. Let your readers interact with your content easy and secure

- Be visible on the web. SEO powered templates will boost your position on search engines results

- Use your own domain

- Want an RSS on it? Just add /feed to the end of your url. Boom!

The only things I dont like are (not talked about in the video)...

- It doesnt display videos or audio players. One would assume it would display at least an html5 player but it strips those out
- There seems to be a problem with getting my domain pointed to it. Not sure if its there end or my end. I follwed the directions and let the dns propgate for a week and it would never show up. So I went back over to Runkod.
- The backend isnt showing the wallet correctly yet. In fact at all.

Other than those two things Engrave is absolutely awesome!
